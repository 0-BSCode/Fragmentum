# Privacy Policy for Fragmentum

**Effective Date:** January 2026
**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

Fragmentum is a Chrome browser extension that helps users collect text fragment highlights from web pages and compile them into shareable links. This privacy policy explains how Fragmentum handles user data.

## Data Collection

Fragmentum collects and stores the following data **locally on your device**:

| Data Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Selected text snippets | To display your saved highlights |
| Page URLs | To organize highlights by webpage |
| Text fragment identifiers | To enable navigation to specific highlights |
| Timestamps | To show when highlights were created |

## Data Storage

- **Local storage only:** All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.local`)
- **No external servers:** Fragmentum does not transmit any data to external servers
- **No cloud sync:** Your highlights are not synced across devices

## Data Sharing

**Fragmentum does not share your data with any third parties.**

- No analytics services
- No advertising networks
- No data brokers
- No external APIs

The only way your highlight data leaves your device is when you explicitly choose to copy and share a compiled highlight URL.

## Permissions Used

Fragmentum requires the following browser permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | To read the current page URL for organizing highlights |
| `storage` | To save your highlights locally on your device |

## User Control

You have full control over your data:

- **View:** See all your saved highlights in the extension popup
- **Delete:** Remove individual highlights or clear all highlights for a page
- **Export:** Copy compiled highlight URLs to share with others
- **Uninstall:** Removing the extension deletes all locally stored data

## Data Retention

- Highlights are stored indefinitely until you delete them or uninstall the extension
- Uninstalling Fragmentum removes all stored data from your device


## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
